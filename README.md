# ClassifyCowMovements
<li> This project we classified nine genral movements by a cow using imu dataset</li>
<li>Traning dataset is eighty percent of total data used to train multi level classification model</li>
<li>Prominent machine learning algoritms were implemted comparing their accuracy after EDA, data preprocessing and scaling the    feature variables</li>
<h2>Labels</h2>
<h3>EATING,DRINKING,WALKING,STANDING,LYING,RUMINATING STANDING, RUMINATING LYING,GROOMING,IDLE </h3>
<h2>Results</h2>
<h3>Knn classifiers are able to predict labels with accuracy of 86.78%</h3>
<h3>QuantileTransformer are used to scale value in Gausian probobility distribution</h3>
